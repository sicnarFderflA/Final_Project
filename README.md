## Important Notice
This project includes a sound file which is crucial for its operation. To ensure the program functions correctly, please download the entire project as a ZIP file. This will include the necessary sound file along with the code.

## Usage Instructions

Follow these steps to successfully set up and run the Turtle Rizz Alarm application:

### Step 1: Download and Extract the ZIP File

- **Action:** Download the project ZIP file from the GitHub repository.
- **How to Extract:**
  1. Locate the downloaded ZIP file on your computer.
  2. Right-click on the file and choose `Extract All` or a similar option depending on your operating system.
  3. Choose a destination folder where you want the files extracted and confirm the action.

### Step 2: Prepare the Application for Execution

#### Running the Python Script

- If your preference is to run the program using the Python script, a small adjustment is required:
  1. Open the Python file in a text editor or IDE.
  2. Navigate to line 21 and remove the "#" symbol at the beginning of the line. This action "uncomments" the line, making it active code that will be executed.

#### Using the Executable File

- To run the program via the executable file, follow these instructions:
  1. Open the project folder where you extracted the ZIP file.
  2. Navigate to the `dist` folder.
  3. Locate the executable (`.exe`) file identified by a turtle icon and double-click it to launch the application.
